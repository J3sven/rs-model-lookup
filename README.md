# Runescape Model lookup

This is a simple barebones web page that parses a collection of data of model indexes for various runescape cache revisions, this is primarily made for my personal use as a contributor to the HDOS project. But if you find any use for this feel free to use it as well, I do not expect this project to get refined or updated often as it was very much quick & dirty work.
